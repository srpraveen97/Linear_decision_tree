# Decision trees with multiple linear regression models

The file DecisionTree_LinearRegression.py contains the class LinearModelTree which is used to perform a decision tree algorithm with a linear regression model at the leaf nodes. 

The purpose of this algorithm is to use a regular decision tree algorithm to build the tree and to use a linear regression model in each of the leaf nodes. A common example for this is the electricity demand forecasting. There is a piecewise linear relationship between temperature and electricity demand, depending on the seasons, hour of the day, etcetera. An example on how to use this algorithm is shown below.

### Example-1

Consider a piecewise linear function as shown below:
